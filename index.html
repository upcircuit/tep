					<h2>What is<br> <strong>The e-waste project</strong>?</h2>
					<div class='writeup'>
						<p>The E-waste Project is a collaborative effort between student organizations to raise awareness on the impending threat that the growing number of improperly disposed old and defective electronic devices pose on the environment. The campaign aims to encourage the practice of proper recycling and disposal of these hazardous and poisonous materials. Each participating community will hold week-long collection drives of electronic wastes. The collected e-wastes will then be sold to an accredited waste management facility. Proceeds of this project will be used to fund a chosen beneficiary.</p>

						<h1>TEP OVER THE YEARS</h1>
						<div class="class writeup">
							<p>The E-Waste Project started off as a university-wide campaign to raise awareness on proper E-Waste Management. During its first years, the proceeds of TEP were used to fund AKBAY (Advanced Knowledge for the Betterment of Aspiring Youth), a project that sought to improve computer literacy by donating new computers to beneficiary high schools.</p>
							<p>In 2013, the year of its first collection drive, TEP was able to fund eleven (11) new computer stations to Sta. Lucia High School, a school which originally had 2 working computers for a population of over 4000 students. In the following years, TEP had also supported beneficiaries Caloocan High School and Caruhatan High School.</p>
							<p>Over the years, TEP has expanded its reach to conduct over 10 collection drives with more than 5 universities and colleges in Metro Manila annually. To further raise awareness, it has also held talks in various schools in the region.</p>
							<p>To honor its contributions to the community, UP Circuit and TEP was also hailed as a finalist in the Ten Accomplished Youth Organization (TAYO) Awards in 2015 and 2017.</p>
							<p>This year, TEP aims to further promote its advocacy and give back to more underserved communities in the region and beyond. Last September 22, TEP partnered with SOLAR Hope, an initiative which provides solar-powered lamps to off-the-grid areas in the greater Manila area, and visited a Badjao community in Batangas to conduct a clean-up drive and feeding program.</p>

					<h2>Brief History of <strong>TEP</strong></h2>
					<div class='writeup'>
						<p>Eight years ago, through UP Circuit's former president Martha Isabel Dealino, The E-Waste Project was born. The E-Waste Project, a.k.a. TEP, is an awareness campaign that aims to inform people about the rapidly-growing problem of improper electronic waste disposal and what they can do to prevent it. Initially, it was first organized in order to raise funds for one of the organization's yearly socio-civic project AKBAY (Advanced Knowledge for the Betterment of the Aspiring Youth) but later on turns into a large-scale project. Its first ollection drive was held at the University of the Philippines - Diliman Campus on January 15-18, 2013. With the cooperation of the UP Diliman Community, partnership with DLSU ECES and a good reception, TEP's starting year was a success.</p>
